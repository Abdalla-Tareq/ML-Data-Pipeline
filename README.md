# ML_Project - Machine Learning GUI Application 🎯

This project is a GUI application built with Tkinter, designed to simplify data analysis, preprocessing, classification, and clustering interactively without the need for coding.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Data Selection** 📂: Users can load a CSV file to explore and analyze its content.
- **Data Preprocessing** 🔄:  
  - Handle missing values (Mean, Median, Most Frequent).  
  - Normalize and standardize data (Normalization & Standardization).  
  - Encode categorical data (OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder).  
  - Feature selection using PCA.  
  - Handle imbalanced data using SMOTE.  
  - Split data into training and testing sets.  
- **Classification** 🤖: Using **SVM, KNN, ANN, Decision Tree** with accuracy evaluation.  
- **Clustering** 🔍: Using **K-Means** with result analysis.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Tkinter** (GUI)
- **Pandas** (Data Processing)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Imbalanced-learn** (SMOTE)

## 🚀 How to Use?

1. Run the application.
2. Select a CSV dataset.
3. Choose the required preprocessing, classification, or clustering operation.
4. Execute the operation and save the results.
