ML_Project - Machine Learning GUI Application 🎯
This project is a GUI application built with Tkinter, designed to simplify data analysis, preprocessing, classification, and clustering interactively without the need for coding.

🔹 Key Features
1️⃣ Data Selection: Users can load a CSV file to explore and analyze its content.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (Mean, Median, Most Frequent).
Normalize and standardize data (Normalization & Standardization).
Encode categorical data (OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder).
Feature selection using PCA.
Handle imbalanced data using SMOTE.
Split data into training and testing sets.
3️⃣ Classification using SVM, KNN, ANN, Decision Tree with accuracy evaluation.
4️⃣ Clustering using K-Means with result analysis.
🔹 Technologies Used
Python 3.12
Tkinter (GUI)
Pandas (Data Processing)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
🔹 How to Use?
1️⃣ Run the application.
2️⃣ Select a CSV dataset.
3️⃣ Choose the required preprocessing, classification, or clustering operation.
4️⃣ Execute the operation and save the results.


🔹 How to Contribute?
💡 If you’d like to contribute, you can:
